# :wave: Reinventing catastrophe modelling

## Introduction
This library aims to develop an approach to catastrophe modelling that combines satellite imagery analysis and geospatial data science.

### Workflow
1. Pulls building footprints and calculate their centroids using Open Street Map.
2. Takes in centroid list from Open Street Map data, and generate timeseries df of satellite band data.

## Setup
