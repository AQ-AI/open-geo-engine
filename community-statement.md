# Community Statement


## Hello All. Welcome to our community!


Tackling the problem of air quality does not yield an easy answer. To address a problem, we need to realize it's an issue. But then, how do we deal with something you cannot see? One of the most dangerous air pollutants, particulate matter PM2.5, is 1/70 the thickness of human hair. These invisible particles take years to cause visible harm, but when they do, unfortunately, it is primarily irreversible! We feel this space is desperately in need of an innovation that goes beyond just using sensor-based reading. So, we, in AQAI, are trying to fuse data sources available on the ground with the satellite-based measurements to create actionable insights for you, me, and our governments to understand the air quality at the local level. Simply monitoring is never enough. We are working on innovative ways to augment these measurements with the advances of AR, and VR to create interactive maps.



Our interdisciplinary work gives you ample opportunity to contribute. We look forward to the feedback from each section of the community to share their views and expertise. The following are various types of communities we seek to work with:



**Technologists'** communities working on software development and data science can contribute to the codebase, API integration, and AI model selection.

**User Experience Designers** can help in presenting the narratives to the global audience.

**Governmental Policymakers** can help us envision the requirements of the governing councils to have clean air.

**Academic Research** community can help us test the frontier technologies which can impact a billion lives.

**Environmental Activists** community can help us by sharing their rich trove of prior knowledge and the right questions to ask.

**Youth-led** community to help us evaluate their local surrounding by augmenting data and demography to understand how air quality is affecting them.

## Vision Statement 

Ensuring and informing the right to cleaner & better for all air quality with open data 


## Mission Statement

We aim to deliver the world's first open-source model measuring air pollution exposure anywhere in the world so that people can make informed decisions.
